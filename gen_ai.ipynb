            "Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning tasks, particularly for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. They consist of an encoder network that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional representation (latent space), and a decoder network that reconstructs the original input from the latent space. Optimizing autoencoders involves finding the optimal values for their trainable parameters, such as weights and biases. Here are some commonly used optimization methods for training autoencoders:\n",

            "RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is an optimization method that also adapts the learning rate based on the average of the squared gradients.

It uses a running average of squared gradients to adaptively adjust the learning rate without the need for an explicit learning rate parameter.
